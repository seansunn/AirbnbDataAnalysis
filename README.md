## Project Description
For this project, I was interested in using the listing data for Airbnb in Seattle to discover what aspects affect the price.

Top 5 features that affect price:
   - Room type(Entire home/apt)
   - Area(Downtown)
   - Property(Bed & Breakfast)
   - Room type(Shared room)
   - Area(Cascade)
