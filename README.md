## Project Description
For this project, I was interested in using the listing data for Airbnb in Seattle to discover:
   - What is the busiest time in Seattle
   - What features affect the price of the Airbnb rentals
   - What features affect the reviews of the rentals

## File Description
There is one jupyter notebook here showing all the work related to the question above, and the Airbnb Seattle datasets from Kaggle packed in zip file. The datasets can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle).
